    <h2>Project 2</h2>
</header>
<article>
<p>I used the same premise as my story for project 1.  The story has to do with touring and driving and band needs.</p>
<p>When on tour all you can think about is how long til we get there and how many shows do we have left.  So with that said I used loops to explain being on the road.</p>
<p>I also used array and string functions to explain what a band needs on tour.  Being in band is much more work than it seems and a lot goes into planning and creating a budget.</p>
